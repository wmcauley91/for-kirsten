		<h2>About the Thyroid Gland</h2>
		<p>The thyroid gland the hormones triiodothyrionine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 and T4 are largely responsible for regulating the metabolic rate, thus influencing how much energy a person can use, and how many calories they burn in a day.
		</p>
		<p>After any surgery involving the thryroid gland, the production of T3 and T4 can decrease, temmporarily or permanently. While the vast majority of patients who undergo a partial thyroidectomy return to full thyroid function within 6-8 months, there are certain nutritional strategies that can aid in its recovery, and help prevent any unwanted side-effects.
