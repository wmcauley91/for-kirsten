		<h2><u>About the Thyroid Gland</u></h2>
		<p>The thyroid gland produces the hormones triiodothyrionine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 and T4 are largely responsible for regulating the metabolic rate, thus influencing how much energy you can use, and how many calories you burn in a day.
		</p>
		<p>After any surgery involving the thryroid gland, the production of T3 and T4 can decrease, temporarily or permanently. While the vast majority of patients who undergo a partial thyroidectomy return to full thyroid function within 6-8 months, there are certain nutritional strategies that you can use can aid in its recovery, and help prevent any unwanted side-effects.

		<h2><u>Important Nutrients</u></h2>
		<p>There are several nutrients and chemicals that act upon the thyroid gland, each of which I've written more about below. Even better, you can click on the name of any of the headings for more information!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Iodine</li>
			<li>Selenium</li>
			<li>Zinc</li>
			<li>Vitamin D</li>
			<li>Goitrogens</li>

		<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iodine//">Iodine</a></h2>
		<img src="img/iodine.jpg" height="132" width="169">
		<p class="caption"><i>Chemical Formula of Iodine</i></p>
		
		<p>Iodine is vital for thyroid health. In order to make T3 and T4, your thyroid gland requires iodine. In the western world it is very rare to be deficient in iodine as there are iodine additives in salt and many foods. Taking an iodine supplement is not recommended as getting too much iodine (an amount impossible to get from food intake alone) has been shown to damage the thyroid gland. Here are some of the best food sources for iodine:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Seaweed</li>
			<li>Fish</li>
			<li>Dairy</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/supplement-guide-selenium#1">Selenium</a></h2>
		<img src="img/selenium.png" height="132" width="300">
		<p class="caption"><i>Chemical Formula of Selenium</i></p>
		<p>Selenium plays a vital role in allowing your body to use T3 and T4, and also acts as an antioxidant, preventing further reduction in metabolic rate. Selenium supplementation tends not to be recommended as, similar to iodine, excessive amounts (quantities impossible to attain from food alone) can be toxic. The best sources of selenium are below, with the first three also being excellent sources of iodine:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tuna</li>
			<li>Sardines</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
			<li>Brazil nuts</li>
			<li>Legumes</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-982/zinc">Zinc</a></h2>
		<img src="img/zinc.png" height="132" width="132">
		<p class="caption"><i>Bohr Diagram of Zinc</i></p>
		<p>Zinc plays a similar role to selenium in that it allows the body to adequately utilise T3 and T4. Unlike selenium, zinc also plays a regulatory role in TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) which helps prevent hypothyroidism by stimulating the thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4. Shellfish are an excellent source of zinc, but have been omitted for obvious reasons... Below are similarly excellent sources of zinc:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Oysters</li>
			<li>Beef</li>
			<li>Chicken</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/">Vitamin D</a></h2>
		<img src="img/vitamin-d.jpg" height="132" width="277">
		<p class="caption"><i>Chemical Formula of Vitamin D</i></p>
		<p>While the mechanism is unclear, low levels of vitamin D have been associated with hypothyroidism, as well as a myriad of other health problems. It is recommended to get adequate vitamin D between exposure to sunlight and supplementation, and this author recommends using the app <a target="_blank" href="http://dminder.ontometrics.com/">dminder</a> to estimate and track vitamin D levels. Some foods that contain high levels of vitamin D are below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Salmon</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
			<li>Tuna</li>
			<li>Mushrooms</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/goitrogens-in-foods">Goitrogens</a></h2>
		<p>Goitrogens are substances that can disrupt normal thyroid function by preventing the uptake of iodine into the thyroid gland. Large amounts of the following foods should be avoided, and if eaten they should be cooked:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Soy (More oat milk flat whites for Kirsten!)</li>
			<li>Cabbage, Broccoli, Kale, Cauliflower, Spinace</li>
			<li>Sweet Potatoes, Cassava, Peaches</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><u>Coffee, Green Tea and Alcohol</u></h2>
		<p>In general, it is recommended to avoid regular, high intakes of these drinks for various reasons, although there does not seem to be any kind of consensus as to what exactly counts as a 'high' dose. It is my opinion that you are not at risk for excessive consumption of either of these three drinks, so don't worry about it :)</p>
